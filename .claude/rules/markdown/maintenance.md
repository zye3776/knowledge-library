# Markdown File Maintenance

<critical_rules>
After creating or updating any markdown file, you MUST:

1. **Remove redundancy** - Eliminate duplicate content, repeated instructions, or overlapping sections
2. **Resolve conflicts** - Fix contradictory statements or inconsistent guidance
3. **Refactor for clarity** - Consolidate related content, improve structure, simplify language
4. **Trim bloat** - Remove unnecessary verbosity, outdated content, or filler text
</critical_rules>

<system_reminder>
Every markdown edit should leave the file cleaner than before. If a file grows significantly, review for consolidation opportunities.
