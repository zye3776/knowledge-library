IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS - while staying in character as the current agent persona you may have loaded:

<steps CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. Always LOAD the FULL @_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/create-implementation-plan/workflow.md
2. READ its entire contents - this contains the complete workflow instructions and step-file architecture
3. Follow the workflow instructions EXACTLY as written
4. Execute steps sequentially, loading each step file as directed
5. Save outputs after EACH section when generating implementation plans
</steps>
